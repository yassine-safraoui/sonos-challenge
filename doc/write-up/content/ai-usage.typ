= AI usage

I used AI tools throughout this project to assist with various tasks. The two main tools were *T3.chat* and *ChatGPT*.

I used *T3.chat* to clarify Rust concepts I didn’t fully understand, to track down bugs and errors, and to get feedback on parts of the code that I felt could be improved or made more idiomatic. It was especially helpful when I wanted a second opinion on implementation details or when something felt “off” in my code.

I used *ChatGPT* mainly to discuss architectural choices and explore design alternatives. I often used the voice mode for this, because talking through ideas out loud helped me refine my thinking, and the model could immediately point out flaws or misunderstandings.

I also used *GitHub Copilot*, but only occasionally. It was helpful for small refactors or quick suggestions, but I found it slower and less practical for deeper problem‑solving, so its role in the project was minimal.
